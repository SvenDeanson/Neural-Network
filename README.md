# Neural-Network

This is a repository for a python neural network code used for recognizing complex solutions.<br>
1) Neural Network <br>
The code for the neural network in this work was constructed mainly on basis provided by Micheal Nielsen ”Neural Networks and Deep Learning” resource. <br> <br>
2) Keras Neural Network <br>
Constructed to compare the results of the first network.
